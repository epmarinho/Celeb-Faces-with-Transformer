# Report on cnn_transformer_core.py:

## Overview:

The code is a Python script that defines a deep learning model for image classification using a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Transformer architecture. The code also includes data loading and preprocessing steps. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:

## Libraries and Modules:

1. The code imports various libraries and modules, including:
   - `torch` and `torch.nn` for PyTorch functionalities.
   - `TransformerEncoder` and `TransformerEncoderLayer` from `torch.nn` for implementing the Transformer architecture.
   - `torchvision` and `torchvision.transforms` for image data processing.
   - `torch.nn.functional` as `F` for additional neural network operations.
   - `h5py` for loading data from an H5 file.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing:

2. The code defines functions for loading class labels and data from an H5 file (`datasets.h5`) using the `h5py` library.

3. It loads class labels for training data from the H5 file using the `load_class_labels_from_h5` function.

4. Training and validation data and labels are loaded from the H5 file using the `load_data_from_h5` function.

5. The NumPy arrays loaded from the H5 file are converted into PyTorch tensors for further processing.

6. Custom PyTorch datasets (`train_dataset` and `validation_dataset`) are created from the loaded tensors.

7. Data loaders (`train_loader` and `validation_loader`) are created to facilitate batch-wise training and validation.

## Model Architecture:

8. The code defines the architecture for the CNN model, which is used for feature extraction:
   - It consists of three convolutional blocks, each followed by batch normalization, ReLU activation, and max-pooling layers.
   - The output of the CNN model is passed through fully connected layers to obtain an embedding of dimensions `cnn_pre_classification`.

9. The code defines the `CNNTransformer` class, which combines the CNN and Transformer:
   - The CNN model is provided as an argument to the `CNNTransformer` class constructor.
   - The TransformerEncoder is configured with a specified number of layers (`transformer_layers`) and attention heads (`num_heads`).
   - After extracting features using the CNN, the data is reshaped for input into the Transformer.
   - The Transformer Encoder is applied to the reshaped features.
   - The features are then transformed back to the original shape and passed through a linear layer for classification.

10. The final model is instantiated with an instance of the `CNN` model and `transformer_layers` set to 8. The number of classes is determined by the loaded class labels.

## Model Training and Usage:

The code provided focuses primarily on defining the model architecture and loading data. The training and evaluation loop is not included in this code snippet. To train and use the model, you would typically need to implement training and evaluation routines, define a loss function, select an optimizer, and run the training loop.

## Additional Notes:

- There are commented-out sections of code that pertain to adding additional dense layers for classification. These layers are currently not used in the provided code but can be uncommented and customized as needed.

- The comments in the code provide helpful explanations of the code's purpose and functionality.

- The code appears to be designed for image classification tasks, particularly for classifying astronomical images. It uses a combination of CNNs for feature extraction and Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies in the data.

- Some hyperparameters, such as the number of CNN output channels and dimensions, dropout rates, and batch sizes, can be adjusted according to the specific problem and dataset.

In summary, this code provides the foundation for a deep learning model for image classification using a combination of CNN and Transformer architectures. To fully utilize the code, you would need to extend it with training and evaluation code and potentially customize the model architecture to suit your specific image classification task.
